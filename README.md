# Rules-
- You will start by flipping over one card<br>
- If the next card you flip matches, you get +50 to your score<br>
- These cards then disspear<br>
- If the next card you flip does not match or you select same card twice,<br>&nbsp &nbspthe cards flip back and your score reduces by 20 or 40 depending on the number of             cards left<br>
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board
